												<h3>Eller's Algorithm [July, 2020]</h3>
												<p> Last 2 months I was so wrapped up with my work. Anyways, among the most efficient maze generation algorithms out there, 
													it is considered to be one of the bests, that's why I wanted to make from ground up. Thanks to Jamis Buck for his awesome blog which helped me a lot understanding the concepts.

												<h3>Random Maze Generation [April, 2020]</h3>
												<p> Learned about various maze generation algorithms. It was part of a coding challenge I faced. I did the whole demo in ~4.5 hours.
													(Maze Generation with single entry-single exit + shortest Path-finding A*). I felt so overwhelmed and nervous at first, but slowly I regained momentum and 
													finished the project. I wish I could finish it within 3 hours, in my defense, I am not used to with this kind of challenges unfortunately. However

												<h3>Dependency Inversion ZENJECT [March, 2020]</h3>
												<p>Here I learned about dependency injection, SOLID principles and an

												documentation of Zenject in github. I learned a lot about DI programming patterns and fell in love with it.

												<h3>Mukticamp [July, 2017] </h3>
												<p>I was part of an excellent team with this project. It was a very ambitious project
													right from the start.
													Its a strategy + RPG game made for android, targeted towards Bangladesh people
													because its based on our Liberation War of 1971.
													I have given the link of the project on playstore. I worked on various things in
													this project like UI,
													3rd party library integration, Optimization, game-play features etc. As I was
													included from the very start,
													I often had to play different roles to make the project work.
													This project started on late 2016 and lasted for about 18-20 months.
													I learned a lot during this time, huge thanks to my mentor Arifur Rahman. </p>

										<h2>My Journey . . .</h2>
									</header>
									<article>
										<div class="content">
											<p> <strong>Start of my game dev journey</strong> <br>
												I graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in computer science in late 2016. During the first two years, I was very confused about what career path to pursue
												as I spent those initial two years
												doing web development. But I knew I have a creative side that I want to embrace. <br>
												Plus, that year in
												2015, I got the first prize in a logo competition. That was a huge moral boost for me.
												So I wanted to work on a more accessible platform where creativity meets technology.
												Then one Friday morning in 2015, at 11:47 AM (Irony is I don't remember the date!),
												I bumped on to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7KSbdIEA0U">video suggestion</a>.
												When I finished the video, I instantly thought to myself I want to pursue that.
												That's why I always feel an obligation to thank Rami Ismail for making me see a life in this
												amazingly interesting world of game development.
												So that was my start on the Game Development journey! <br><br>
							
												<strong>Professional Career</strong> <br>
												I have been working professionally in game development since July 2016.
												Throughout that whole year, I worked heavily in game development making casual games.
												Then I got a permanent job in December 2016. After about 6-7 months working there, the company
												merged with another small indie studio.
												Together we formed a new company named Mindfisher. But our project remained the same.
												So I worked with the same group of people for about 2 years.
												In mid 2018, I moved to my current company, Ulka Games (subsidy of MoonFrog). Right now, I am
												working on arcade/board games here.
												<br><br>
												<strong>Technology</strong> <br>
												I mostly worked with Unity, but also have significant experience with Cocos2d. I also worked with
												Game Maker Studio way back.
												I am pretty comfortable to switch platforms if needs be.<br><br>
							
												<strong>A bit about myself</strong> <br>
												I was born on 18th September, 1994. I am the youngest in my family. From my childhood, I am a bit
												introvert.
												I had a band when I was in school. I miss that life very much. I love all sorts of music and admire
												every genre.
												Among computer games, I LOVE Dota 2. I mainly like strategy based games like age of empire,
												commandos, shadow-tactics, desparados etc.
												I am also very fond of story driven games like Telltale's Walking Dead, Mafia 1 & 2. <br>
							
												Also, I have a cat. I love him more than I can express. :) <br><br>
							
												<strong>Last Words</strong><br>
												I love my work as a game maker. I believe that I still have a lot to learn,
												but I am trying my best to get there day by day. I am very confident in my diligent work ethics and
												my
												capability of learning new things. I am a constant learner.
												I know my strong suits as well as my weaker ones. I don't shy away from new or
												unknown technology as long as it is related to games.
							
												<br><br>
												<strong> I don't work to be in my comfort zone, I work to enhance it! </strong>
												<br> I hope one day, I will make my maa and my family proud of me.
												Cheers! <br>
												Thank you so much for your attention.
												<br><br> --- Ashraf </p>
