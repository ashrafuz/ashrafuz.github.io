												<h3>Mukticamp [July,2017] </h3>
												<p>I was part of an excellent team with this project. It was a very ambitious project right from the start. 
													Its a strategy + RPG game made for android, targetted towards Bangladesh people because its based on our Liberation War of 1971. 
													I have given the link of the project on playstore. I worked on various things in this project like UI, 
													3rd party library integration, Optimization, game-play features etc. As I was included from the very start, 
													I often had to play different roles to make the project work. 
													This project started on late 2016 and lasted for about 18-20 months. 
													I learned a lot during this time, huge thanks to my mentor Arifur Rahman. </p>

								<h2>About Me</h2>
							</header>

							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/about_me.jpg" alt="" /></a>

							<p><strong>Start of my game dev joruney: </strong> <br>
								I graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in computer science in late 2016. I have been making games since third
								year into my BSc. During the first two years, I was very confused about what career path to pursue as I spent my first two years
								doing web development. But I knew I  have a creative side that I want to embrace. Plus, that year in 2015, I got the first prize in a logo competition. That was a huge moral boost for me. 
								So I wanted to work on a more accessible platform where creativity meets technology. 
								Then one Friday morning in 2015, at 11:47 AM (Irony is I don't remember the date!), 
								I bumped on to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7KSbdIEA0U">video suggestion</a>. 
								When I finished the video, I instantly thought to myself I want to pursue that. 
								That's why I always feel an obligation to thank Rami Ismail for making me see a life in this amazingly interesting world of game development.
								So that was my start on the Game Development journey. <br><br>

								<strong>Professional Career:</strong> <br>
								I have been working professionally in game development since July 2016. 
								Throughout that whole year, I worked heavily in game development making casual games. 
								Then I got a permanent job in December 2016. After about 6-7 months working there, the company merged with another small indie studio.
								Together we formed a new company named Mindfisher. But our project remained the same. 
								So I worked with the same group of people for about 2 years. 
								In mid 2018, I moved to my current company, Ulka Games (subsidy of MoonFrog). Right now, I am working on arcade/board games here. 
								<br><br>
								<strong>Technology:</strong> <br>
								I mostly worked with Unity, but also have significant experience with Cocos2d. I also worked with Game Maker Studio way back.
								I am pretty comfortable to switch platforms if needs be.<br><br> 
								
								<strong>A bit about myself:</strong> <br>
								I was born on 18th September, 1994. I am the youngest in my family. From my childhood, I am a bit introvert.
								I had a band when I was in school. I miss that life very much. I love all sorts of music and admire every genre.
								Among computer games, I LOVE Dota 2. I mainly like strategy based games like age of empire, commandos, shadow-tactics, desparados etc. 
								I am also very fond of story driven games like Telltale's Walking Dead, Mafia 1 & 2. <br>
								
								Also, I have a cat. I love him more than I can express. :) <br><br> 

								<strong>Last Words:</strong><br>
								I love my work as a game maker. I believe that I still have a lot to learn, 
								but I am trying my best to get there day by day. I am very confident in my diligent work ethics and my 
								capability of learning new things. I am a constant learner. 
								I know my strong suits as well as my weaker ones. I don't shy away from new or 
								unknown technology as long as it is related to games.

								<br><br>
									<strong> I don't work to be in my comfort zone, I work to enhance it! </strong>
									<br> I hope one day, I will make my maa and my family proud of me.
									Cheers! <br>
								Thank you so much for your attention. 
								<br><br> --- Ashraf </p>
